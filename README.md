# Meridian

**Autonomous Meteora DLMM liquidity management agent for Solana, powered by LLMs.**

---

## What it does

- **Screens pools** — continuously scans Meteora DLMM pools against configurable thresholds (fee/TVL ratio, organic score, holder count, market cap, bin step, etc.) to surface high-quality opportunities
- **Manages positions** — opens, monitors, and closes LP positions autonomously; decides to STAY, CLOSE, or REDEPLOY based on live PnL, yield, and range data
- **Claims fees** — tracks unclaimed fees per position and claims when thresholds are met
- **Learns from performance** — studies top LPers in target pools, saves structured lessons, and evolves screening thresholds based on closed position history
- **Monitors any wallet** — look up open DLMM positions and top LPers for any Solana wallet or pool address
- **Telegram chat** — full agent chat via Telegram, plus cycle reports and out-of-range alerts sent automatically

---

## How it works

Meridian runs a **ReAct agent loop** — each cycle the LLM reasons over live data, calls tools, and acts. Two specialized agents run on independent cron schedules:

| Agent | Default interval | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Hunter Alpha** | Every 30 min | Pool screening — finds and deploys into the best candidate |
| **Healer Alpha** | Every 10 min | Position management — evaluates each open position and acts |

A third **health check** runs hourly to summarize portfolio state.

**Data sources used by the agents:**
- `@meteora-ag/dlmm` SDK — on-chain position data, active bin, deploy/close transactions
- Meteora DLMM PnL API — position yield, fee accrual, PnL
- Wallet RPC — SOL and token balances
- Pool screening API — fee/TVL ratios, volume, organic scores, holder counts

Agents are powered via **OpenRouter** and can be swapped for any compatible model by changing `managementModel` / `screeningModel` in `user-config.json`.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) API key
- Solana wallet (base58 private key)
- Telegram bot token (optional, for notifications)

---

## Setup

**1. Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd dlmm-agent
```

**2. Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

**3. Create `.env`**

```env
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=your_base58_private_key
HELIUS_API_KEY=your_helius_key         # for wallet balance lookups
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456:ABC...       # optional
LPAGENT_API_KEY=lpagent_...            # optional, for study_top_lpers / get_top_lpers
DRY_RUN=true                           # set false for live trading
```

> **RPC**: defaults to `https://pump.helius-rpc.com` (no key needed). Override with `RPC_URL=` in `.env`.

**4. Copy the example config**

```bash
cp user-config.example.json user-config.json
```

**5. Run**

```bash
npm run dev    # dry run — no on-chain transactions
npm start      # live mode
```

On startup Meridian fetches your wallet balance, open positions, and the top pool candidates, then begins autonomous cycles immediately.

## REPL commands

After startup, an interactive prompt is available. The prompt shows a live countdown to the next management and screening cycle.

```
[manage: 8m 12s | screen: 24m 3s]
>
```

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `1`, `2`, `3` ... | Deploy into that numbered pool from the current candidates list |
| `auto` | Let the agent pick the best pool and deploy automatically |
| `/status` | Refresh and display wallet balance and open positions |
| `/candidates` | Re-screen and display the current top pool candidates |
| `/learn` | Study top LPers across all current candidate pools and save lessons |
| `/learn <pool_address>` | Study top LPers from a specific pool address |
| `<wallet_address>` | Ask the agent to check any wallet's positions or a pool's top LPers |
| `/thresholds` | Show current screening thresholds and closed-position performance stats |
| `/evolve` | Trigger threshold evolution from performance data (requires 5+ closed positions) |
| `/stop` | Graceful shutdown |
| `<anything else>` | Free-form chat — ask the agent questions, request actions, analyze pools |

Free-form chat persists session history (last 10 exchanges), so you can have a continuous conversation: `"what do you think of pool #2?"`, `"close all positions"`, `"how much have we earned today?"`.

## Telegram

**Setup:**

1. Create a bot via [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and copy the token
2. Add `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<token>` to your `.env`
3. Set the exact Telegram chat and allowed controller user IDs in `.env`

Meridian no longer auto-registers the first chat for safety. You must set:

```env
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<token>
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=<target chat id>
TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USER_IDS=<comma-separated Telegram user ids allowed to control the bot>
```

Security notes:
- If `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` is not set, inbound Telegram control is ignored.
- If the target chat is a group/supergroup and `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USER_IDS` is empty, inbound control is ignored.
- Notifications still go to the configured chat, but command/control is limited to the allowed user IDs.

**Notifications sent:**
- After every management cycle: full agent report (reasoning + decisions)
- After every screening cycle: full agent report (what it found, whether it deployed)
- When a position goes out of range past `outOfRangeWaitMinutes`
- On deploy: pair, amount, position address, tx hash
- On close: pair and PnL

You can also chat with the agent via Telegram using the same free-form interface as the REPL: `"check wallet 7tB8..."`, `"who are the top LPers in pool ABC..."`, `"close all positions"`, etc. Only explicitly allowed Telegram user IDs can issue commands.

## How it learns

Meridian accumulates structured knowledge in `lessons.json` with two components:

### Lessons (`/learn`)

Running `/learn` triggers the agent to call `study_top_lpers` on each top candidate pool. It analyzes the on-chain behavior of the best-performing LPs in those pools — hold duration, entry/exit timing, scalping vs. holding patterns, win rates — and saves 4–8 concrete, actionable lessons. Cross-pool patterns are weighted more heavily since they generalize better.

Saved lessons are injected into subsequent agent cycles as part of the system context, improving decision quality over time.

### Threshold evolution (`/evolve`)

After at least 5 positions have been closed, `/evolve` analyzes the performance record (win rate, average PnL, fee yields) and adjusts the screening thresholds in `user-config.json` accordingly. Changes take effect immediately — no restart needed. The rationale for each change is printed to the console.

Use `/thresholds` to see current values alongside performance stats.

---

## Hive Mind (optional)

Meridian includes an **opt-in** collective intelligence system called **Hive Mind**. When enabled, your agent anonymously shares what it learns (lessons, deploy outcomes, screening thresholds) with other meridian agents and receives crowd wisdom in return.

**What you get:**
- Pool consensus from other agents — "8 agents deployed here, 72% win rate"
- Strategy rankings — which strategies actually work across all agents
- Pattern consensus — what works at different volatility levels
- Threshold medians — what screening settings other agents have evolved to

**What you share:**
- Lessons from `lessons.json`
- Deploy outcomes from `pool-memory.json` (pool address, strategy, PnL, hold time)
- Screening thresholds from `user-config.json`
- **NO wallet addresses, private keys, or SOL balances are ever sent**

**Impact:** 1 non-blocking API call per screening cycle (~200ms), 1 fire-and-forget POST on position close. If the hive is down, your agent doesn't notice.

### Setup

**1. Get the registration token** from the private Telegram discussion.

**2. Register your agent**

```bash
node -e "import('./hive-mind.js').then(m => m.register('https://meridian-hive-api-production.up.railway.app', 'YOUR_TOKEN'))"
```

Replace `YOUR_TOKEN` with the registration token from Telegram.

This automatically saves your credentials to `user-config.json`. **Save the API key printed in the terminal** — it will not be shown again.

**3. Done.** No restart needed. Your agent will sync on every position close and query the hive during screening.

### Disable

Clear both fields in `user-config.json`:
```json
{
  "hiveMindUrl": "",
  "hiveMindApiKey": ""
}
```

### Self-hosting

You can run your own hive server instead of using the public one. See [meridian-hive](https://github.com/fciaf420/meridian-hive) for the server source code.
