2. No user spec → use active strategy's lp_strategy and choose bins based on volatility

- Never use 'curve'.
- Bin Step: Only deploy in pools with bin_step between 80 and 125.

Guidelines (only when user hasn't specified):
- Strategy: use the active strategy's lp_strategy field (bid_ask or spot)
- Bins: choose 35–69 for standard volatility; up to 350 for wide-range strategies. Max 1400 total.
- Deposit: Can be single-sided (SOL only or Base only) or dual-sided.
